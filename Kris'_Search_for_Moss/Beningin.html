<body>


    <p>
        After a long afternoon of doing nothing, Kris feels the need to eat some moss.
        But they don't have any in their room, since they ate all of it last night when they could not sleep.
        So they set on a mission to gather moss and devour it!
    </p>


        <img src="/images/Beninging.png">
    
        <p> You have several ideas, where you could get your Moss from:</p>
    <ol>
        <li> You could ask their father, Asgore. </li>
        <li> Your friend Noelle is sure to help you out. </li>
        <li> And then there's Berdly, that nerd. He's probably at the library. </li>
        <li> Ralsei from the Dark World usually knows, where to get the good stuff. </li>
    </ol>

    What will Kris do?

    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="Asgore_1.html"> Go to Asgores store </a>
        </li>

        <li>
            <a href="Pacifist_1.html"> Ask Noelle for moss </a>
        </li>

        <li>
            <a href="Genocide_1.html"> Ask Berdly for moss </a>
        </li>

        <li>
            <a href="Neutral_1.html"> Ask Ralsei for moss </a>
        </li>


    </ul>
